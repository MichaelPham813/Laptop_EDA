# Laptop_EDA


##Introduction
This repository is my attempt at exploratory data analysis (EDA). The dataset i use is laptop inventory. [Click Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ehtishamsadiq/uncleaned-laptop-price-dataset).
 
##About the data
The data was not clean, which require me to clean it on both Excel, and Tableau. If i had more time and knowledge, i would have clean it even more by splitting GPU and CPU even further to help me visualize which brand has more product in the warehouse.

##Difficulty
Since this is my first attempt at EDA, it will have some error, and i will miss some information that could be crucial for future reference and decision.
