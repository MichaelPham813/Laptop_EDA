# Laptop_EDA


## Introduction
This repository is my attempt at exploratory data analysis (EDA). The dataset i use is laptop inventory. [Click Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ehtishamsadiq/uncleaned-laptop-price-dataset).
 
## About the data
The data was not clean, which require me to clean it on both Excel, and Tableau. If i had more time and knowledge, i would have clean it even more by splitting GPU and CPU even further to help me visualize which brand has more product in the warehouse.

## Difficulty
Since this is my first attempt at EDA, it will have some error, and i will miss some information that could be crucial for future reference and decision, and i use Tableau Public instead of Tableau Desktop (i'm using Tableau Desktop as of now).

## Conclusion
The result is very interesting, and the visualization does answer some basic questions (e.g. What GPU is more preferrable in different laptop type ?). [Visualization](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/duc.pham3667/viz/PortfolioVizLaptopData/Dashboard1)
